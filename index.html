                <h2>The State of Boy Groups</h2>
                <p class = "subtext">October 1, 2024 by Tara-Lee Donald</p>

                <p>Boy groups, you love them, you hate them. Perhaps stanning them is your dark past or happy future. However, one thing cannot be denied, The boys groups that you listened to then are not the same as now. Today, we are seeing an emergence of global groups instead of your typical British or American groups. This could all tie back into the effects of globalization. This digital age we are in allows us to connect with people we would never have otherwise. That, however can go vice versa. We are connecting with groups who never once ha the chance to reach out to the audience that they have today. That begs the question, dear viewer, has boy groups over the years really changed or are we seeing groups that have always been there?  </p>

                <p>Well, let's take BTB for example. Upon their American debut, they blew other groups out of the park with impressive choreography, an astounding fan support and impeccable fashion. To many at the time, this was novel, something that had never been seen before. That fact may be true, it was something that had never been seen before. Additionally BTB's first language wasn't even English and yet they managed to inspire English and non-English speakers alike. Yet, they are not the only ones who present this. Many boy groups in Asia have been using this formula and yet none have seen the heights that BTB has reached. Yet, many people claim boy groups are now changing to fit the standards that BTB has raised the bar to. I think it would be easy to then conclude that the so called "changing state of boy groups" is just the general public taking note of a certain genre or area and putting it in the limelight. After all, the R&B groups of old or the Pop hearthrobs of the 90s and early 2000s still exists, they're just not that popular. </p>
